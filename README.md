Analyzing the 2016 elections using sentiments of news articles from Alchemy DataNews and demographic information of counties.

It appears that there is slight correlation to the sentiment of articles and the polling performance of a candidate. When comparing performance in a poll that started on a date vs the article sentiment of a candidate on that date, we can see the graphs forming similar trends.

This correlation can be a result of multiple factors. For instance, the articles took a more positive tone during each candidate's convention, which corresponded with their convention "bumps." Also, there are times where the relationship between polling and sentiment would be a two way relationship. If a candidate has poor polling numbers, articles will reflect this in taking on a negative sentiment. However, we can also see a candidates numbers slip when negative stories (such as the Clinton email investigation) break.

These two data points seem to have interesting trends, but there are many other factors that contribute to polling numbers.
